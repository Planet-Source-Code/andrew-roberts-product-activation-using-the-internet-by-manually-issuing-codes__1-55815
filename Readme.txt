Thanks for downloading this example.

To get this to work:

1.) Uplod the file writeFile.php onto your host and change the URL in the code. There must be a folder matching the productID in the same directory as writeFile.php. I have already set this up on my host so you can use that to test it out.

2.) Compile project1.vbp in the same directory on your hard-drive (exe name: codeGen.exe)

3.) compile aboutProg/project1.vbp in the same directory as step 2 (exe name: about.exe)

4.) Compile wizard/project1.vbp in the same directory as step 2 (exe name: project1.exe)

5.) run codeGen.exe and type in a serial code. This code will be saved to about.exe and then you can ship this file out with your program so that you issue serial codes. There cannot be duplicate serial codes because only one of them will work when they are validated using the server.

6.) run about.exe. There should be no sign of the serial code you just typed in.

7.) run project1.exe. Type in your name. If it says it already registered then someone else on planetsourcecode has already used this serial code and the software can't be registered.

That's it. 

You can put this code into your own programs if you want you don't have to credit me.
